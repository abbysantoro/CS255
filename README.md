Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The ficticious client wanted to create a system called DriverPass that would allow for perspective drivers to be able to access online study materials, schedule an inperson driving lesson, as well as be able to display feedback from lessons and online quizzes. 

What did you do particularly well?

I really enjoy making models and graphs and I feel that these are the areas that I excelled in specifically for the DriverPass project.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

In hindsight I think that it would have been beneficial for me to add another "actor" onto my systems design template there should not only be a user and administartor I could have been more specific and had a srudent user and a seperate instructor user. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Ultimately the user is the one the system is designed for and the user is the one who will actually deem the system to be successful or not. Keeping the user in mind while programing is imperative because most users will have little to no tech knowledge so the system needs to be simple and user friendly. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I think this course has made me realize how important having multiple models that depict different parts of the system and how it interacts to be very important and this can cause issues and questions to come up and be answered before any coding is even started. I also think collecting and finalizing system requirements with the client is extremely helpful to manage expectations for everyone involved.
